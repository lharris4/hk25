## Model description: 

X-SHiELD is the eXperimental System for High-resolution prediction on Earth-to-Local Domains, a Global Storm Resolving Model (GSRM) or kilometer-scale (K-scale) model run at a sufficiently high global resolution to explicitly simulate individual convection cells. X-SHiELD is a configuration of SHiELD, which couples the nonhydrostatic [GFDL Finite-Volume Cubed-Sphere Dynamical Core (FV3)](www.gfdl.noaa.gov/fv3) to a modified form of NCEP's Global Forecast System (GFS) physical parameterizations, NOAH Land-surface Model, and a mixed-layer ocean. 

X-SHiELD is GFDL’s contribution to the DYAMOND project. It has been used in collaboration with AI2 Climate Modeling, Princeton University, and community partners, and represents a key deliverable of the [NOAA Research Global-Nest Initiative](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/noaa-research-global-nest-initiative/).
